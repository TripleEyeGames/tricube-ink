# This Repository
This repository was created to practice using Ink, and to determine if a Tricube Tales one-pager could be implemented into a video game.

To write a story, a storyteller should create a character.ink and a story.ink file (although these could be in the same file, once the character.ink file has been made, it should require few changes as it contains all of the relevant character information for the story, whereas the story.ink file contains the story itself). The storyteller also needs to include a copy of the system.ink and system-private.ink files in the same folder as the story.ink and character.ink files.
