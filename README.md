# This Repository
This repository was created to practice using Ink, and to determine if a Tricube Tales one-page adventure could be implemented as a video game.

The answer is "yes, kind of": a storyteller can write a pre-defined adventure story [^1] using Tricube Tales rules, which players can then experience at their own pace.

To write a pocket adventure, a storyteller should create a character.ink and a story.ink file. [^2] The storyteller also needs to include a copy of tricube-tales-pocket-adventures.ink and tricube-tales-pocket-adventures-private.ink files in the same folder as their character.ink and story.ink files.

[^1]: What's referred to here as a "Pocket Adventure".
[^2]: Although these could be in the same file, once the character.ink file has been made, it should require few changes as it contains all of the relevant character information for the story, whereas the story.ink file contains the story itself.
